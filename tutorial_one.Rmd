```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)        ## install.packages("skimr")
library(dplyr)

# ALT plus hypen = <- (within chunk)
# ctrl plus shift plus m = %>% 
# ctrl + ALT + I = insert chunk
# filter rows, select columns

```



<!-- 
use this code for comments between chunks
-->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Tutorial Practice
### Header Format

**bold** <br>
*italics*



```{r cars}
summary(cars)

x <-  3 * 4
(x)
```

## Including Plots


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
